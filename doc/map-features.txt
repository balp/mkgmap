You can completely change which features are displayed and at what zoom
levels.

First you need to understand a little about the way that the zoom works
in Garmin maps.  There are two concepts that I am going to call
'resolution' and 'level'.

The first is 'resolution' this is a number between 1 and 24 with 24 being
the most detailed resolution and each number less is half as detailed.
So for example if a road was 12 units long at resolution 24 it would be
only 6 at resolution 23 and just 3 at resolution 22.

The next is 'level'.  This is a number between 0 and 16 (although perhaps
numbers above 10 are not usable), with 0 corresponding to the most
detailed view.
