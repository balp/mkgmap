This page shows you how to design your own mkgmap style.
A style is used to choose which OSM map features appear in the
Garmin map and what Garmin symbols are used.

As there are many different purposes a map may used for, the default
style in mkgmap will not be ideal for everyone.  So a mechanism to allow
different named styles to be included within mkgmap has been developed.
You can also create and use styles external to mkgmap.

==Writing a style==
A style consists of a number of files in a single directory.
The best way is to start out with an existing style that is close to what
you want and then work from there. ''TODO: link to example template''

A complete description of the format of all the files that make up a
style follows.

===First steps===
Choose a short name for your style, it should be one word or a couple of
words joined by and underscore or hyphen.  This is how people will refer
to the style when it is finished.

Create a directory or folder with that name.  Then you must create
several files in this directory as detailed below.  Only the ''version''
and ''map-features.csv'' files are required in the current version.

===version===

This file must exist as it is used to recognise a valid style.
It contains the version number of the style format itself (not the
version of the particular style) and it should contain a single
number which currently should be zero.
Make sure that there is a new line after the number, place an empty line
afterwards to be sure.

===map-features.csv===
For backward compatibility this file is exactly the same as the file that
previously used to hold the styling rules.  As the new format advances
then this file will become less important.

Currently though, it contains all the style information, see the
old [[Mkgmap/help/custom|mkgmap style customisation page]] for details
of the contents of this file.

===options===
This file contains a number of options that should be set for this style.
In some cases they can also be set on the command line to override the
choice of the style designer.

==Testing a style==
You can test your style by calling mkgmap with the
<code>--style-file</code> argument and the name of the directory or
folder that contains the style.

 ... --style-file=path-to-style ...

==Packaging a style==
A style can be used just as it was created, but if you want to make it
available to others it will be easier if you make a zip file out of it
and then you just have the one file to distribute.

Several different styles can be placed into the same zip archive file.
