<h3>Main programs</h3>
<p>This package contains all the main entry points.
    For making a map, you need to use {@link uk.me.parabola.mkgmap.main.MakeMap}.
</p>
<p>There are other programs for testing.
For all these programs you can supply a latitude,longitude on the
command line to re-locate the map to somewhere convenient.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>MakeTestMap</dt>
    <dd>Creates a very simple map with a few roads on it.  This
        was used to veryfy the basic structure of the file.</dd>

    <dt>MakeTestPointMap</dt>
    <dd>Makes a map that consists only of points.  Each point has a
        different type and subtype.  The name of the point is that type
        and subtype.  This way you can investigate what they all mean.</dd>

    <dt>MakeTestPolygonMap</dt>
    <dd>Just like the test point map, but this time for polygons.  There
        should be one for lines too, but there isn't just yet.</dd>
