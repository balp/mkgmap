<h1>Reader for OSM binary format</h1>
<p>There are a number of binary formats, this format is Scott Crosby's
binary format based on Google's protobuf.</p>

<p>To make use of this reader you must have the java protobuf library
as well as Scott's OSM-binary package http://github.com/scrosby/OSM-binary</p>

<p>The format is a storage format designed to be quicker and smaller than the
XML format but preserve the element ordering and features of that format.
We can therefore pretty much re-use most of the code that is used for reading the
XML format.</p>
