<h3>Map building code</h3>
<p>This is the code that converts from the general representation to the the
garmin representation.

<p>The general representation is just one layer at the level of detail in
the OSM file.  This must be then coverted to several layers at different
levels of detail.  This is what the files in this package do.</p>
