<h3>The TRE and RGN files</h3>

<p>These files are so inter dependant that it only makes sense to put
them into the same package.</p>

<h4>The TRE file</h4>
<p>This file describes the structure of the map.  It contains the
zoom levels that exist in the map and how the map is divided up.</p>
<p>There are in effect several copies of the map at different levels
of detail.  Each level is divided up into several areas known as subdivisions.
	These subdivisions form a tree, with more detailed ones being children of
	the higher (less detailed) levels.
</p>

<h4>The RGN file</h4>
<p>This file contains the detailed location and path of all the map
objects.  Pointers from the TRE file indicate the start of the definition
of a map object and information from the TRE section needs to be used
to work out where the location of the map object is.</p>
