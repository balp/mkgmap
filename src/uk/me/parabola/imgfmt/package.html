<h3>The IMG file format</h3>

<p>The IMG file is internally structured like a file-system containing
    a number of files and a directory. It is common to refer to the whole
    thing as a file and the contained files as sub-files. However I use the
    terms file system and file respectively, because it is more descriptive of
    what is going on I think.</p>

<p>There are two main sub-packages here.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>fs</dt>
    <dd>This deals with filesystem as a whole. The individual files are just
        blobs of data. You could handle any filename at this level.
    </dd>

    <dt>app</dt>
    <dd>Code for actual application files that are used. Code in here knows
        about the internal structure of individual files.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>As the purpose of this application is to write IMG files (there are plenty
    of programs that read it), the focus is on writing and not reading. The
    code to read at the filesystem level will probably be implemented at some
    stage so that we can combine several .img files into one gmapsupp.img
    file.</p>
