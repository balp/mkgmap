<h3>The MPS file</h3>

<p>This file is similar to the TDB file in that it is a list of maps along with
	other information describing the set.  It is inserted into the gmapsupp.img
file.  Maps appear to work without it, so I don't know what effect it has -
is it informational, or does it help speed operations by providing an index?
I don't know.</p>

<p>It isn't like the other files in the app package, for a start it doesn't
	begin with the common header.  It should perhaps live with the TDB format or
in a similar top level place.  It is here because it is included inside the
gmapsupp.img file and doesn't normally have a separate existance.</p>

	The names and lengths of the fields were obtained from the program gpsexplorer
