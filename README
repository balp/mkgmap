Making maps for Garmin GPS units
================================

The goal of the project is to take OpenStreetMap data and put it on
my Garmin Legend Cx to help show me when mapping what is done and
what is not.

As such, at least to begin with, the map will only be available at high
zoom and will only show ways with names.
