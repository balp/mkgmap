Making maps for Garmin GPS units
================================

The goal of the project is to take OpenStreetMap data and put it on
my Garmin Legend Cx so that I can see what is already mapped and what
needs doing.

As such, at least to begin with, the map will only be available at high
zoom and will only show ways with names. Routing and the like is not a goal
of the project.

Using
=====

Due to the complete lack of implemented options it is very easy to use.
Change into the distribution directory and run the command

	java -jar mkgmap.jar data.osm

It will produce a file called 63240001.img.

You can copy the map to your Garmin GPS unit in any way you know how. On my
Legend Cx connected to a Linux system I put the unit into USB mass storage
mode, mount the filesystem on the memory card, and copy the map to
Garmin/gmapsupp.img  Note that this will replace any other map you have on
there.  Another way would be to use a USB memory card writer.
It should be possible to use sendmap, but I've not tried.

You should see a OSM copyright message on starting up (although this is not
working at present), and the map name 'OSM Street map' should appear
in the map setup section.

You should see an outline of the map when zoomed out, but you will not
see any streets until you are zoomed in quite close.  On mine I have to
be zoomed to 120m.

Issues
======

The program has the following limitations at present.

1. You must be zoomed in close to see anything except an outline; there
   is just one zoom level.
2. There is a limit to the size of the map you can create. It will be
   around 1Mb.  I've done a large chunk of North London without getting
   anywhere near the limit though.  This is the next thing to be tackled.
3. Non-ascii characters will not show up.  The format for Garmin maps
   condenses text down to 6 bits per character.  This only leaves room
   for uppercase ascii characters and a few symbols.  You can specify
   the use of more bits (8 and 10 bits) but I don't know how those
   formats work.  I'd be very grateful if someone knows or can work
   them out.


Acknowledgements
================

This project is almost entirely based on the file format specification
document written by John Mechalas at the SourceForge project at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/garmin-img.  The 'imgdecode' program
from the same source was also very important in checking that I was
on the right lines to producing a good file.  Thanks.
