OSM 0.5 api XML format
----------------------
This is the newer format consisting of just nodes and ways, that is
due to go live on Sun 7 Oct 2007. This is recognised by looking for
the version declaration within the file. Once the 0.5 version is
established, then this will become the default version for mkgmap. 

Polish format
-------------
This reads the map format that is read by cGPSmapper and produced
by map editing programs such as GPSMapEdit. If an input file ends
with .mp the it is assumed to be in this format. The support is
pretty basic and is more of a proof of concept. It does handle
some files well though. 

Test maps
---------
There are some built in maps in mkgmap. These all have names
beginning test-map:. This is a way of producing a map for
development purposes without actually needing an input file.
The ones available may change over time. The most useful one
that is likely to stay contains every single element that can
be displayed in a Garmin map. To produce this map, just use
test-map:all-elements instead of a file name. 

  mkgmap test-map:all-elements
