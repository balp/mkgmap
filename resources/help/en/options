Options:

-c filename
	The given file is opened and each line is an option setting of the form
	option=value, just like on the command line except that there is no
	leading '--'. 

-n name
--mapname=name
	Change the name of the map. Garmin maps are named by 8 digit numbers.
	The default is 63240001. It is best to change the name if you are going
	to be making a map for others to use so that it is unique and does not
	clash with others. 

--description=text
	Sets the descriptive text for the map. This may be displayed in
	QLandkarte, MapSource on on a GPS etc. 

--map-features=file
	Use your own map features file. You can totally change which features
	are shown and at what levels. See customisation help. 

--levels=levels code
	Change the way that the levels on the map correspond to the zoom levels
	in the device. See customisation help. The default is the equivalent
	of: "0=24, 1=22, 2=21, 3=19, 4=18, 5=16" although this may change. 

--latin1
	This option allows the use of non-ascii characters in street names. It
	is hardware dependant what is actually supported on a particular
	device. Some devices can only do ascii characters for example. 

	Mkgmap goes to some length to convert un-displayable characters however. It
	will convert accented characters that cannot be displayed in the chosen
	character set into unaccented characters.
