#
# An ordering of characters for a given code page.
# Characters are represented either as themselves (in unicode) or
# as two hex digits in the target codepage.
# Characters later, reading left to right from top to bottom, sort
# after those that are earlier in the file.
#
# There are three ordering strengths represented in this file.
#
# These are Primary (different letters), secondary (different
# accents), tertiary (different case).
# See the java documentation for the Collator class for some more
# discussion of the strength concept and examples.
#
# Note that primary differences always determine the order even if
# they are later in the word than secondary differences.
# ie A B comes after A-acute A, even though A-acute sorts after A.
#
# In this file Primary differences are represented by lines begining
# with the keyword 'code'.  All the letters following are the same
# letter ignoring case and accents.
# Characters with secondary differences are separated by semicolons
# and characters with tertiary differences are separated by commas.
#
# You can also separate different letters with '<' instead of starting a new
# 'code' line.
#
# You can split lines after a semi-colon or comma, but otherwise a new
# line ends the 'code' command.


# This must be first before any 'code' lines.
