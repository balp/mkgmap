There are three files: garmin_feature_list.csv, osm_garmin_map.csv and
feature_map.csv.

Currently only feature_map.csv is used within mkgmap, and the other two are
used to generate it.  This may change though.

garmin_feature_list.csv
-----------------------

This is list of the map features that are available on the Garmin devices.
It is probably not complete.  It gives a way of naming the features so that
it is easier to use.

The fields are:
1. The type of feature: point, polyline, polygon.
2. Name for type
3. Name for subtype (only points have a subtype)
4. Not used
5. The numeric code for the feature that is actually used in the map.
6. Same but for the sub-type. (points only).
7. A more descriptive name (not used)

osm_garmin_map.csv
------------------

This is a list of OSM map features and the corresponding Garmin feature
name.

The fields are:
1. The kind of feature on OSM: point, polyline or polygon.
2. The OSM key name, this is taken from the first column in the table on the map
features page on the wiki.  For example 'highway'.
3. The OSM value.  This is taken from the second column on the map features page on
the wiki.  For example when the key is 'highway', you might have motorway
here.
4. The garmin type name that should be used for the OSM feature.
5. (points only) the garmin sub-type name that should be used for the OSM
feature.
